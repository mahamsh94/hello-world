# hello-world
My introductory repository.


Hi everyone! My name is Maham and I have two years of experience in Cybersecurity, and I'd also like to try my hand at the development side of the IT world. That's why I'm here, to learn the ropes of github, and hoopefully move into learning full stack development.

Thanks for reading!!
