# hello-world
My introductory repository.


Hi everyone! My name is Maham and I have two years of experience in Cybersecurity. I'd also like to try my hand at the development side of the IT world. That's why I'm here -- to learn the ropes of github, and from there, I'll hopefully move into mastering full stack development.

Thanks for reading!!

Edited to add: I know know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!!
